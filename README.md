I have learned how to create methods and interact with them throughout my code using def and fucntion calls.
I demonstrated the use of new imports and and how to develop a proper cashe for the information to be put into, which helps with data storage and memory.
I focused on dealing with errors and working around them to handel exceptions and prevent overflow or any type errors
I worked with loops to create the button system, where the buttons will always be available because they are in a continueous loop
I used if and else statements to give the buttons their function and to help prevent any bugs in the program

In the first few chunks of the code, I focused on keeping the driver information together make sure it is running first. I have had issues in the past
where the data doesn't load corrcetly, so I wanted to focus on creating stable methods that use checks to help the fastf1 database run smoothly throughout
the program. I had to check for an error in the first method because that was where I have had my problems in the past. I was able to use exception handeling
to keep the driver information where it was meant to regardless of any DNF's or any driver lineup changes.

I was unable to get the driver information to show, when the button was clicked but it is definitly something I am going to work on to ensure the program runs exactly as I want it to.
Only the driver numbers are shown after you select a race so later on I am hoping to get the driver names (last names) on the results standings and then when you click from there
it will bring up full driver information: full name, number, home country, highest finish, championship wins, race wins, etc.

I then loaded in the information into the buttons and then loaded the buttons into the loop. I learned that this was ideal to have the buttons in some sort of loop to keep the buttons functionable. 
There needs to be something running within them to allow them to be continuously pressed or switched back and forth. I am also hoping to impliment a functioning back button to clear the 
current screen and reset the fucntions.
